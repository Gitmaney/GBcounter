1. What excites or interests you about coding? What did you learn this week?
    The thing that excites me about coding is the way we can manipulate the overall look of the system or the contents that you want to change according to your liking. Also there are much more new coding techniques that we can learn to help solve problems or just enhance the solution. 
    This week I learnt about the use of React hooks for localStorage and most about the animation styling.

2. What is a recent technical challenge you experienced and how did you solve it?
    The recent technical challenge that I experienced was when I was creating a login page and got stuck during the authentication process for login. To help me solve this challenge I got help from a friend and stackoverflow.

3. Talk about your preferred development environment (tools and technologies you prefer using) or a cool project that you've recently worked on (if any).
    Development environments I use is mostly VSCode for any language I'm working on and mostly have been using for React and Android Studio for mobile development. The most recent project I've worked on was an app for a Notification System but only on the designing and frontend part. 

4. What is your general expectation from this internship program?
    General expectations from this internship program for me is to learn more about the environment that I'll be working on and creating much more better contents. I would like to learn and develop the skills with some personal development which might help me develop my carrer as well.
    
5. What mediums do you prefer to learn programming?
    I started to learn programming during my high school days when we learned about web development and then started gaining interest in programming and joined an IT major. I mostly use online documentaions and online tutorials(mostly have been using freeCodeCamp, codeacademy, YouTube) about the language that I'm trying to learn.
